            SITE | ECOLOGY | DESIGN is a RISD architecture studio in which students engage with 
            issues of remediation through the hands-on study of an urban waterfront
            shaped by millennia of natural processes and centuries of human interaction.

            <br><br>

            The coastline of the Narragansett Bay and Seekonk River have been drastically transformed in the 
            past centuries since the marshes were filled in, altering the coastal ecology in service of local
            shipping and manufacturing industries.

            Sitting on the east bank of the Seekonk in Providence, the Phillipsdale Historic District is a mill
            village covering over 80 acres of land. Phillipsdale Landing is a 25-acre peninsula in the region that 
            lies vacant, decades after the last factory in a long series of shipping, manufacturing, and forgery companies
            shut its doors. Approximately 75% of the total site acreage is classified as a
            combination of disturbed fill and impervious surfaces.

            Despite the land's apparent deterioration, it maintains an extraordinary sense of place and distinct visual
            identity. Many industrial artifacts remain intact, creating a constellation
            of past memorabilia among pockets of regrowth, patches of restoration. I wrote an essay on this tactile experience
            for The Forager, a student environmental literary magazine:
            <a href="https://www.theforagerzine.com/written/pre-colonial-forging-post-industrial-foraging-seeking-stories-of-production-on-the-seekonk">Pre-Colonial Forging, Post-Industrial Foraging: Seeking Stories of Production on the Seekonk</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "Foraging the remains of a demolished steel forgery, I can't help but play with these words in my mind:
            forage, forge. Forage. Forge. They appear to be complete opposites, yet in a different light they are exactly the same.
            <br><br>
            Forge: to make or shape.
            <br><br>
            Forage: to search, to obtain.
            <br><br>
            The word connecting them both, I believe, is assemble. To forage is to assemble is to forge, and vice versa."
        </p>

        <p class="pad">
            The studio environment gave me opportunity to extend the theories and themes I'd learned in the classroom to the specific
            context of the Phillipsdale Landing site, while exploring the relationships between human/nature, foraging/forging,
            stewardship/ownership, tradition/technology, de/composition, and de/colonization across a variety of mediums: found
            objects, projection drawings, 3D models, photography, writing, and digital renderings.

        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "This land has long been home to narratives of creation: from today's industrial factories, tangled in the global web of
            capital, to yesterday's local economy of Naragansett artisanship. But even long before this land was touched by human
            hands, it was still a hub of production. The lifecycle of an ecosystem necessarily involves bringing objects into
            existence. Compounds assemble to create organisms anew; life forms amass to form symbioses. Human supply
            chains and ecological food chains apply the same principles of cyclic creation across vastly different beings and scales.
            After all, a tree and a factory are both plants."

            For my final site plan I designed a minimally invasive proposal to encourage natural succession and regeneration
            through the creation of more-than-human habitat, biodiverse native planting, and regenerative agriculture.

            <br><br>

            My core design principles were decolonization, ecological succession, urban agriculture, indigenous knowledge, and more-than-human cohabitation.

            Inspired by Tuck &amp; Yang's seminal work,
            <a href="https://clas.osu.edu/sites/clas.osu.edu/files/Tuck%20and%20Yang%202012%20Decolonization%20is%20not%20a%20metaphor.pdf">
                decolonization is not a metaphor</a>,
            an integral aspect of my site plan was repatriation of the land to its original
            stewards, under whose care it previously flourished: the Naragansett people.

            <br><br>

            The proposal leaves most of the site's surface area undeveloped to allow a slow recovery from decades of contamination,
            but it includes limited human-oriented programming on the uncontaminated north-east region of the site.
            This programming centers around community gardens with plots available to local renters who lack access to private
            land, in an effort to increase access to green space and reduce local food insecurity. The plan includes a pavilion
            and walking path, as well as a seed library and
            composting facility to encourage regenerativity and self-containment.

            I designed terraced gardens to work with the land's existing slope, increase water conservation,
            and avoid digging into the nutrient-depleted soil.
            Community gardens would create a safe and accessible public space to practice method
            indigenous to the Seekonk region, such as companion
            planting, intercropping, polycultures.

            Lining the 800-foot path from the community gardens down to the shore are a series of retention ponds for irrigation.
            The walking path ends with a boardwalk overlooking Omega Pond. The brackish water of the Seekonk presents a suitable
            climate for microalgae farming, which could be used as carbon sequestration, biomass fuel, or nitrogen-additive for composting.

            <br><br>

            The space would be co-operated by community organizations such as the Narragansett Food Sovereignty Initiative,
            Tomaquag Museum, Zero Waste Providence, Groundwork Rhode Island, and the Southside Community Land Trust. Individual
            garden plots would be free to East Providence residents.

            A remediation strategy that balances more-than-human regeneration with light-touch human intervention can transform
            the site a productive landscape once more. This transition signifies a departure from the toxic, linear
            production of the site's industrial legacy, and a return to its naturally regenerative ecosystem under the
            stewardship of the Narragansett peoples.
