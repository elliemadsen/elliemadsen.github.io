    This procedurally generated terrain environment was created from scratch in
    C++ with custom GPU shaders. Users can customize parameters such as terrain
    scale, biome distribution, normal mapping, texture mapping, fog, and
    lighting. The terrain can also be exported as an obj file for use in other
    3D software.
    <br /><br />

    The terrain is segmented into sub-regions and a value noise function is used
    to determine which biome (plains, hills, mountains) to generate. A smooth
    interpolation between biomes is achieved by weighing the height of each
    biome and updating the total output height. The biome value noise function
    is scaled by user input, which in turn scales up and down the amount each
    biome appears on the terrain.
    <br /><br />

    Normal mapping was implemented with a custom vertex shader and fragment
    shader. There are five different texture maps in the scene: day sky, night
    sky, sunset sky, grass, and rock. The fragment shader also inlcudes custom
    fog and lighting effects.
