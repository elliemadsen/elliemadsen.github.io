    <i>Critical Atlas of Satellite Embeddings</i> is the capstone research
    project I completed for my degee in Computational Design Practices at
    Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Preservation, and
    Planning.

  <h4>Research Statement</h4>
  <br />

  <p>
    Collective understanding of embedded data in Earth Observation lags behind
    the rapid production of remote sensing foundation models. Data
    visualization, critical cartography, media studies, and theories of the
    archive offer vital conceptual frameworks to situate this novel technology
    in the context of the broader trajectory of digital ecology and to provide
    human-comprehensible form and meaning to high-dimensional latent space.

  <h4>Project Description</h4>
  <br />

  <p>
    My research explores the novel application of foundation models to remote
    sensing. My methods include experimental data analysis, theoretical and
    technical writing, critical cartography, elemental media studies, topology,
    machine learning, and speculation. I conducted a range of experiments using
    these methods to explore and explain various properties of Earth embedding
    data. The resulting content is presented in an atlas in both physical and
    digital forms.
    <br /><br />
    Over the last few years, there has been a steady release of new remote
    sensing foundation models in Earth Observation. RSFMs are large-scale
    machine learning models trained primarily on satellite imagery, but also on
    aerial, radar, thermal, climate, and other data. They learn—or
    predict—generalized spatial-temporal representations of Earth's surface.
    These general-purpose models are intended to perform a range of downstream
    tasks, including clustering, crop type mapping, classification, and object
    detection via similarity search.
    <br /><br />

    RSFMs compress huge amounts of Earth observation data into a unified digital
    representation, or embedding. The data is embedded as high-dimensional
    vectors, which together construct latent space: a raster image painted by
    the brushstrokes of a billion embeddings. For example, in Google's
    AlphaEarth satellite embedding dataset, released in July 2025, each pixel
    represents 10 m, and each 10 m region is embedded into a 64-dimensional
    vector.
    <br /><br />

    Planetary geographical data is inherently spatial-but when it is embedded,
    the remote sensing data constructs a new space: latent space. Imagine a 3D
    sphere, but make it 64 dimensions. Considering the spatial limits of human
    perception, how might we make sense of high-dimensional data?
    <br /><br />

    I conceive of this embedding space as a different, not-for-human world: a
    world without clouds, where no one lives, locality is universal, distance is
    semantic, and places are queried like the web. Yet this world has its own
    topology and texture. My research exists in the irony between calling for a
    human understanding of Earth embeddings and acknowledging that attempting to
    see like machines is a losing game. What is created and lost when we embed,
    interpolate, predict, simulate, and represent?
    <br /><br />

    Yet I am less interested in what geospatial embedding data can tell us about
    the world than in what this methodology tells us about ourselves. Applying
    theories of the archive allows us to think of big data in terms of
    narrative, knowledge, and control. What if, instead of taking these data at
    face value and using embeddings as a method to understand the Earth, the
    subject of study is the embeddings themselves—as a form of matter in their
    own right?
    <br /><br />

    My research explores the high-dimensional turn of planetary mediation across
    themes of sparsity, dimensionality, scale, distance, and temporality.

  <h4>Computational Methods</h4>
  <br />

  <p>
    I apply computational methods in machine learning, GIS, and exploratory data
    analysis to uncover and illustrate the properties, limits, edge cases,
    opportunities, and formal characteristics associated with Earth embedding
    data. My technical approach utilises cartography, data visualization,
    classification, change detection, dimensionality reduction, projection,
    false-color composites, and web design. I employ a range of computational
    tools and libraries including Python, JavaScript, Google Earth Engine, UMAP,
    t-SNE, QGIS, MapLibre, GDAL, GeoJSON, SciPy, Adobe Illustrator, HTML/CSS,
    d3.js, and three.js.
