  I created a digital narrative atlas documenting physical interventions by the
  United States in Greenland from the twentieth century to the present. Rather
  than offering a comprehensive geopolitical history, the work is deliberately
  grounded in specific sites of material contact, including military bases,
  research stations, and other infrastructures. By spatially and temporally
  locating various archival materials, I illustrate how military and ecological
  violence are inscribed onto Greenland's landscape.
  <br /><br />

  The atlas includes the following sites: Pituffik Space Base (formerly Thule
  Air Base), Camp Century, Camp TUTO, Camp Fistclench, Project Iceworm,
  Narsarsuaq Air Base, Inge Lehmann Station, Station Nord, and the DYE/DEW Line.
  They are documented through archival maps, photographs, satellite imagery,
  technical diagrams, plans, declassified documents, and investigative material.
  <br /><br />

  I employ critical cartography to highlight the tensions between the ice (vast,
  dynamic, geological time scale) and its imposing architectures (discrete,
  static, human time scale). The physical traces of the Cold War that remain
  embedded in the ice tell this story. By focusing on specific sites and moments
  of contact I allow the objects speak for themselves, narrating one piece of
  the broader history of geopolitical strategy, international relations, and
  environmental change.

  <br /><br />
  Heat functions as a thematic throughline linking Cold War militarization,
  glacial engineering, nuclear infrastructure, and contemporary climate change.
  For example, Camp Century, a secret U.S. Army base built under the ice sheet
  in the 1960s, relied on the ice to act as a thermal sink for its nuclear
  reactors. The base and its radioactive waste were abandoned under the ice in
  1967 - but recent studies show that climate change induced ice sheet melting
  is expected cause the nuclear waste to resurface within the century, posing an
  environmental hazard for Denmark. Yet, ironically, the United States military
  emits more greenhouse gases than the entire country of Denmark. Camp Century
  illustrates how temperature operates across temporal scales to destabalize
  notions of permanence and stability.

  <br /><br />

  My infrastructure-oriented approach offers a new lens for understanding the
  United States' continued interest in acquiring Greenland as a strategic
  territory for military opportunity and resource extraction, grounding this
  obfuscated history in specific concrete interventions and their enduring
  material consequences.
