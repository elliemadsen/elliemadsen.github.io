    <i>asciiworld</i> is an interactive web environment that explores themes of
    worldbuilding, hypertext, gaming nature, digital gardening, and information
    poorness. The visual abstraction of the rendered environment works as a
    metaphor for the whimsical and subversive user experience. <br /><br />

    From 7 bits arise a discrete set of 128 characters, which give way to
    infinite combinations of graphical representation. Up close we read each
    character as a discrete element: #, $, %. Zooming out, the figure becomes an
    effect emerging from the field itself: a moment of intensity, a peak or
    valley.
    <br /><br />
    ASCII art flattens the character; letters are not to be read by humans as we
    are taught, nor by machines as they are trained. The characters are stripped
    of meaning, semiotically void. Their affordances lie in their visual density
    - the ratio of positive to negative space, ink to paper — allowing for
    alternate readings: character as text, as image, as hyperlink, as word, as
    world.
    <br /><br />

    Sonya Rapoport, a pioneer of computer art, describes her work as “an
    aesthetic response triggered by scientific data.” She uses computers to make
    “tracings of her personal vocabulary icons, developing themes and stories
    with words.” In Donna Haraway's Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction, she contrasts
    the traditional linear hero's journey—the spear—with the historically
    feminine narrative taking the shape of a bundle, a container, a bag for
    gathering. The world I have created is one manifestation of such: characters
    not written by humans as logical strings nor read by machines as binary
    sequences, but symbols that are gathered, planted, shared, and jumbled.
    Haraway states: "Perhaps it is precisely in the realm of play, outside the
    dictates of teleology, settled categories, and function, that serious
    worldliness and recuperation become possible."
    <br /><br />

    My ASCII world lives inside the carrier bag. Worlds are weaved from a cosmos
    of binary decisions. We exist in an era of hi-definition computer graphics,
    hyper-resolute virtual realities, and attempts to render digital experiences
    in the image of our mind's eye, to be experienced as one experiences the
    physical world. There is a reactionary urge to turn back to the handmade
    web, low tech interventions, information poorness, data sparsity. I inch
    towards the threshold at which an image, rendered computationally, might
    disintegrate into abstraction. In the gaps left behind by the absence of
    vivid renderings, popup ads, and infinite scrolls, there is space. I intend
    to pry this space open: to let it grow, expand, and inside, to search for
    its poetic capacity.
