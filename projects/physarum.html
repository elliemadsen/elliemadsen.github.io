    I created a generative agent-based Physarum slime mold simulation script in
    Grasshopper that can be applied to biomorphorphic structural design.

    <br /><br />

    Physarum is a slime mold that forms efficient networks balancing robustness
    and shortest path without any centralized intelligence. This is executed
    through many local interactions: the organism spreads randomly, senses
    chemical signals, and reinforces paths where more nutrients flow. In my
    algorithmic implementation, this translates to an agent-based simulation
    model. Each agent senses its surroundings by sampling a numerical field,
    adjusts its direction toward stronger signals and deposits a trail as it
    moves. Over many iterations, trails accumulate into branching and merging
    network structures. Each agent's path is recorded as a polyline, normalized
    to the simulation's bounding box, and then remapped to the target surface
    domain to conform the generative structure to a 3D facade geometry.

    <br /><br />

    Parametrized user inputs include agent count, sensor angle, sensor offset,
    step size, number of steps, pipe radius, sample rate, and facade surface
    geometry.

  <br /><br />
  I build upon previous work in Physarum simulation by contributing a 3D
  implementation in Grasshopper. Rather than producing a visual representation
  of the organism, my implementation generates a structural model that bridges
  the gap between research and parametric design.
