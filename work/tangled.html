                <i>entangled</i> is a runway collection inspired by organic shapes that draw upon patterns found in nature. Webs, networks, nests,
                and cells become stitches, knits, tangles, and cutouts. All fabric was sourced second-hand, and many pieces were made without using a sewing
                machine at all. By engaging with the fabric tactilely, I imitated processes of decomposition and composition, rearranging familiar materials like
                rugs, bedsheets, and curtains in subversive ways.

                <i>entangled</i> was showcased in the 12th annual Fashion @ Brown Runway Show in March 2022.
