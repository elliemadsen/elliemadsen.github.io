            <p class="pad">
                In an Architecture Design Studio course at Brown, I was tasked with designing a home for a Buddhist monk on a 20x20' plot of
                land in Providence, RI.
                <br><br>
                I identified several key aspects of monastic life to guide my design principles: material simplicity, modesty,
                minimalism, domestic labor, privacy, sustainability, and connection nature.
                <br><br>
                The four-level spatial plan segments the space into functional tiers. At the lowest level, an underground cellar
                and woodshed represent the most labor-intensive aspects of monastic life. The next level houses most daily activities
                and includes a bathroom, kitchen, and wood-burning stove. It is partially inset underground for insulation. The ground
                floor serves as a meditation and ritual space, symbolizing a physical and metaphorical elevation above the material
                needs of daily life. Windows placed above eye level allow natural light while maintaining privacy. This floor has direct
                access to a Japanese garden and stone meditation labyrinth. Finally, the upper loft is a place for sleep, the most
                transcendent of habits. Suited for a humble floor mat, it is directly above the wood-burning stove for optimal heating.
                <br><br>
                To minimize the resident’s environmental footprint and encourage rituals of labor, the home’s roof includes a
                vegetable garden and rain collection system.
                <br><br>
                The structure is composed of a locally sourced timber frame and straw bale infill, providing natural insulation and
                serving as a substrate for an exterior layer of plaster. These substances adapt traditional Buddhist temple materials
                to a New England climate, while the refined modern exterior accommodates the neighborhood’s visual language.
