                In the Brown University course Architecture Design Studio, my final project was to design and model a house for a hypothetical monk to live
                in on a 20 x 20' plot of land in Providence, RI. After many iterations, my final design included features that provoke physical habits of monastic 
                living: movements of labor, minimalism, sustainability, domesticity, and privacy. The house is structured in a four-level spatial plan and
                includes an underground cellar, wood-burning stove, high windows, meditation space, rooftop gardens, and thick adobe walls.
