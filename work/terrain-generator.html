      <p class="pad">
        For the final project of
        <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/avandam/">Andries van Dam</a>'s
        <a href="https://cs1230.graphics/">CSCI 1230: Computer Graphics</a>, I
        built an interactive terrain environment that is rendered in real time.
        It includes a procedurally generated landscape of three different biomes
        (hills, mountains, and plains) with three different light settings (day,
        dusk, and night). <br /><br />
        The model is rendered with OpenGL and coded in C++ with GLSL for the
        shaders. We built the project in QT Creator, allowing users to build and
        run the program as an app. In the app, users can change the scale and
        octaves of the terrain noise functions, change the scene's background,
        and toggle features such as normal mapping, texture mapping, and fog.
        The customized terrain mesh base can also be exported as an .obj file to
        be imported into other programs like Maya.
      </p>

      />

      <p class="pad">
        The terrain is generated in 9 subsections, each of which contains a
        value noise function that determines which biome should appear at each
        point in the terrain. These noise functions are scaled based on user
        input to determine the proportion of the terrain each biome should
        occupy. The height of each biome is weighted to achieve smooth
        interpolation between them.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        The model uses five different texture maps: day sky, night sky, sunset
        sky, grass, and rock. It also includes two normal maps: grass and rock.
        These required implementing custom vertex shaders and fragment shaders.
        In the shaders, we calculate the UV coordinates and then sample the maps
        to get the corresponding vectors, which are then applied to the output
        color. The texture and normal maps for rock and grass are interpolated
        based on y-value. The level of normal mapping applied at different
        points in the scene is adaptive based on camera view, such that points
        closest to the camera are most detailed.
        <br /><br />
        To add a fog effect, we calculate a fog color using a linear equation,
        interpolate between the fog color and the terrain color values, and
        apply this to the Phong lighting model.

      <h3 class="pad">Ray Trace Renderer</h3>
      <p class="pad">
        Also in Computer Graphics, I independently wrote a recursive ray tracer
        in C++. This project involved implementing core ray tracing techniques
        from scratch. To render the geometry, I calculated ray intersections
        with basic primitives (spheres, cubes, cones, cylinders) using implicit
        equations. I created a camera model to generate rays through each pixel
        of the image plane and handled transformations between world space,
        camera space, and object space. For the lighting, I implemented a Phong
        illumination model with directional lights, including calculations for
        ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections. The program can also render
        advanced lighting effects, including point lights, spot lights with
        attenuation, and realistic shadows. I then wrote custom texture mapping
        by calculating UV coordinates for each shape and blending the texture
        with the object's diffuse color. Finally I implemented recursive
        inter-object reflections to accurately simulate interactions between
        shiny objects in the scene.
