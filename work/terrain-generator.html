                For the final project of
                <a href="https://csci1230.graphics">CSCI 1230: Computer Graphics</a>, taught by
                <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/avandam/">Andries van Dam</a>,
                I built an interactive terrain environment that is rendered in real time. It includes a procedurally generated landscape of three different biomes (hills, mountains, and plains) with three different light settings (day, dusk, and night).
            </p>

            <p class="about-me pad" style="width: 900px;">
                The model is rendered with OpenGL and coded in C++ with GLSL for the shaders. We built the project in QT Creator, allowing users to build and run the program as an app. In the app, users can change the scale and octaves of the terrain noise functions, change the sceneâ€™s background, and toggle features such as normal mapping, texture mapping, and fog. The customized terrain mesh base can also be exported as an .obj file to be imported into other programs like Maya.

                The terrain is generated in 9 subsections, each of which contains a value noise function that determines which biome should appear at each point in the terrain. These noise functions are scaled based on user input to determine the proportion of the terrain each biome should occupy. The height of each biome is weighted to achieve smooth interpolation between them.

                The model uses five different texture maps: day sky, night sky, sunset sky, grass, and rock. It also includes two normal maps: grass and rock. These required implementing custom vertex shaders and fragment shaders. In the shaders, we calculate the UV coordinates and then sample the maps to get the corresponding vectors, which are then applied to the output color. The texture and normal maps for rock and grass are interpolated based on y-value. The level of normal mapping applied at different points in the scene is adaptive based on camera view, such that points closest to the camera are most detailed.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me pad" style="width: 900px;">
                To add a fog effect, we calculate a fog color using a linear equation, interpolate between the fog color and the terrain color values, and apply this to the Phong lighting model.
