        Through the interplay of decomposition and composition, material and
        immaterial, this digital universe explores the glitches that emerge
        between the physical and virtual.
        <br /><br />
        The scene objects were 3D scanned from natural specimens in the RISD
        Nature Lab using an Occipital Structure Sensor and imported into Unity.
        The landscape terrain was scanned from a hand-constructed textile,
        transforming stitches into rocks and fabric folds into hills. This
        subversion of scale invites users to encounter familiar objects through
        a lens of estrangement and discovery. Dynamic fractal texture mapping
        adds sensory complexity to obscure the objects' original forms. The
        Unity environment is interactive, with elements such as music, texture,
        object physics, and fog responding to the user's movements.
        <br /><br />
        We did not aim for technical believability nor realistic representation,
        but rather a distinctly digital space that foregrounds abstraction and
        otherworldliness. We embrace the glitch as both a reminder of our
        earthly origins and a marker of the imperfect translation between
        realms.
        <br /><br />
        Our process of worlding is a mode of decomposition, compressing
        subjective sensory forms into discrete parametrized geometries. Yet it
        is simultaneously an act of composition, transforming static time and
        place bound objects into dynamic assemblages. The representation of the
        objects themselves becomes an experience separate from their tactile
        embodiment, unrecognizable yet born of the same seed.
        <br /><br />
        The world was exhibited for
        <i
          >Digital Worlding: Terraforming Future, Fact, Fiction, and
          Fabulation</i
        >
        in an installation that included the physical source materials and
        original music. The projection of the virtual world onto the original
        textile completed the cycle of physical-to-digital-to-physical
        transformation.
