                Complex stream networks have been observed in detail on the Southwest Greenland Ice Sheet. These channels control
                drainage efficiency and timing, which has important effects on the rates of local surface melt, ice sliding velocity,
                and sea level rise. However, because the channels are only 1-20 m wide and are highly dynamic over space and time, they
                require repeated high resolution satellite imagery to map. Multiple semi-automated methods have been proposed to
                detect the streams from satellite imagery, but these methods have not used artificial intelligence techniques and
                heavily rely on tedious manual labor.
                To advance this research, for our final project in 
                <a href="https://brown-deep-learning.github.io/dl-website-2021/index.html">CSCI 1470: Deep Learning</a>
                we sought to use deep learning to digitize these networks by training a convolutional neural network on Northwest
                Greenland satellite imagery.

                We used a high-resolution July 2012 Worldview satellite image and two manually digitized river networks to train a
                convolutional neural network as an image segmentation problem. The satellite image and corresponding rasterized
                shapefile networks were split into 100 pixel (50m) squares for training. 70% of the image tiles were used for
                training and 30% of the image tiles were used for testing; as the distribution of the river network was relatively 
                uniform across both networks, tiles were shuffled randomly during training.

                Our model's architecture is comprised of four convolutional layers to extract features, then three linear layers
                to produce the segmented output.

                To evaluate the model, we initially utilized a basic cross-entropy loss while training the model, and a simple accuracy
                metric (correctly classified pixels : all pixels) to evaluate. When training and evaluating the model over 5 epochs using
                this loss, however, to minimize loss the model would output blank images with ~96% pixel accuracy, due to
                the reletave absence of positive area in the training images, or output noisy results with ~66% pixel accuracy.

            <p class="pad">
                We suspect the model may not have had sufficient training data to find optimal layer weights. This could be improved in
                future studies by inclusion of more training data, which would require more manual digitization of stream networks.
                Alternatively, given the prevalence of melt ponds on the surface of the ice sheet that resemble river stretches, the task
                may be aided by a more specific approach than blackbox network training. For example, performing edge detection and filtering
                results to include stretches above a threshold number of adjacent pixels may be used to outline river stretches.
                Deep learning might find a similar procedure with more data, but a non deep-learning approach may be more appropriate in this
                relatively data-poor scenario.
