            SITE | ECOLOGY | DESIGN was an architecture studio in which students engaged with issues of remediation
            through the hands-on study of an urban waterfront
            shaped by millennia of natural processes and centuries of human interaction.

            <br><br>

            The coastline of the Narragansett Bay and Seekonk River have been drastically transformed in the past centuries since
            the  marshes were filled in, altering the coastal ecology in service of local
            shipping and manufacturing industries.

            Sitting on the east bank of the Seekonk in Providence, the Phillipsdale Historic District is a mill
            village covering over 80 acres of land. Phillipsdale Landing is a 25-acre peninsula in the region that 
            lies vacant, decades after the last factory in a long series of shipping, manufacturing, and forgery companies
            shut its doors. Approximately 75% of the total site acreage is classified as a
            combination of disturbed fill and impervious surfaces.

            Despite the land's obvious deterioration, it maintains an extraordinary sense of place and distinct visual
            identity, as many industrial artifacts remains intact. I wrote an essay about the tactile experience of
            foraging this barren wasteland for memorabilia of the past and glimpses of future restoration while
            untangling its rich history. It was published in The Forager, a student environmental literary magazine.
            To learn more about Phillipsdale Landing's past and present, read

            "Foraging the remains of a demolished steel forgery, I can't help but play with these words in my mind:
            forage, forge. Forage. Forge. They appear to be complete opposites, yet in a different light they are exactly the same.
            <br><br>
            Forge: to make or shape.
            <br><br>
            Forage: to search, to obtain.
            <br><br>
            The word connecting them both, I believe, is assemble. To forage is to assemble is to forge, and vice versa."

            The S|E|D studio provided opportunity to extend the theories and themes I'd learned in the classroom to the specific
            context of the Phillipsdale Landing site, while exploring the relationships between human/nature, foraging/forging,
            stewardship/ownership, tradition/technology, de/composition, and de/colonization  across a variety of mediums: found
            objects, projection drawings, 3D models, photography, writing, and digital renderings.

            "This land has long been home to narratives of creation: from today's industrial factories, tangled in the global web of
            capital, to yesterday's local economy of Naragansett artisanship. But even long before this land was touched by human
            hands, it was still a hub of production. The lifecycle of an ecosystem necessarily involves bringing objects into
            existence. Compounds assemble to create organisms anew; life forms amass to form symbioses. Human supply
            chains and ecological food chains apply the same principles of cyclic creation across vastly different beings and scales.
            After all, a tree and a factory are both plants."

            For my final site plan I designed a minimally invasive proposal to encourage natural succession and regeneration
            through the creation of more-than-human habitat, biodiverse native planting, and regenerative agriculture.

            <br><br>

            My core design principles were decolonization, ecological succession, urban agriculture, indigenous knowledge, and more-than-human cohabitation.

            Inspired by Tuck & Yang's seminal work,
            <a href="https://clas.osu.edu/sites/clas.osu.edu/files/Tuck%20and%20Yang%202012%20Decolonization%20is%20not%20a%20metaphor.pdf">
                decolonization is not a metaphor</a>,
            an integral aspect of my site plan was repatriation of the land to its original
            stewards, under whose care it previously flourished: the Naragansett people.

            <br><br>

            The proposal leaves most of the site's surface area undeveloped to allow a slow recovery from decades of contamination,
            but it includes limited human-oriented programming on the north-east (least-polluted) region of the site.
            This programming centers around community gardens to grow food for humans and animals, with the goal of minimizing
            local food insecurity and creating habitat for primary species.

            I designed terraced gardens to avoid digging into contaminated soil,
            work with the land's existing sloped contours, and increase water conservation of runoff.
            I envision the gardens to be a place to practice traditional Indigenous agricultural techniques, such as companion
            planting, intercropping, and polycultures. The center also includes a seed library and composting facilities, to ensure 
            that future land usage remains regenerative and self-contained.

            From the community gardens down to the coast are a series of retention ponds for irrigation and a walking path that
            ends at a boardwalk overlooking Omega Pond, with opportunities for algae farming.

            <br><br>

            The space would be co-operated by community organizations such as the Narragansett Food Sovereignty Initiative,
            Tomaquag Museum, Zero Waste Providence, Groundwork Rhode Island, and the Southside Community Land Trust.

            By balancing more-than-human regeneration with light-touch human intervention, the site will begin its
            transformation to a productive landscape once more. This transition signifies a departure from the toxic, linear
            production of the site's past, and a return to the circular production of its natural ecosystem under the
            stewardship of the Narragansett peoples.
