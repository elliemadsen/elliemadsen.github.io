        SITE | ECOLOGY | DESIGN is a RISD architecture studio in which students
        engage with issues of remediation through the hands-on study of an urban
        waterfront shaped by millennia of natural processes and centuries of
        human interaction.

        <br /><br />

        The coastline of the Narragansett Bay and Seekonk River have been
        drastically transformed in the past centuries since the marshes were
        filled in, altering the coastal ecology in service of local shipping and
        manufacturing industries. Today, the Rhode Island Department of
        Environmental Management classifies the Seekonk as an impaired waterway.

        Sitting on the east bank of the Seekonk River in Providence, Rhode
        Island, the Phillipsdale Historic District is a mill village that spans
        over 80 acres of land. Occupying the southwest corner of the district is
        Phillipsdale Landing, a vacant 25-acre plot of abandoned asphalt,
        concrete and steel infrastructure slowly giving way to early
        successional species. Decades after a series of shipping, manufacturing,
        and forgery companies, approximately 75% of the site is classified as a
        combination of disturbed fill and impervious surfaces.

        Despite the land's apparent deterioration, it maintains an extraordinary
        sense of place and distinct visual identity. Many industrial artifacts
        remain intact, creating a constellation of past memorabilia among
        pockets of regrowth, patches of restoration. I wrote an essay on this
        tactile experience for The Forager, a student environmental literary
        magazine:
        <a
          href="https://www.theforagerzine.com/written/pre-colonial-forging-post-industrial-foraging-seeking-stories-of-production-on-the-seekonk"
          >Pre-Colonial Forging, Post-Industrial Foraging: Seeking Stories of
          Production on the Seekonk</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p class="quote">
        "Foraging the remains of a demolished steel forgery, I can't help but
        play with these words in my mind: forage, forge. Forage. Forge.
        <br /><br />
        Forge: to make or shape.
        <br /><br />
        Forage: to search or obtain.
        <br /><br />
        They read as stark opposites, yet in a different light they are exactly
        the same.
        <br /><br />
        The word connecting them both, I believe, is assemble. To forage is to
        assemble is to forge, and vice versa."

        The studio environment gave me opportunity to extend the theories and
        themes I'd learned in the classroom to the specific context of the
        Phillipsdale Landing site, while exploring the relationships between
        human/nature, foraging/forging, stewardship/ownership,
        tradition/technology, de/composition, and de/colonization across a
        variety of mediums: found objects, projection drawings, 3D models,
        photography, writing, and digital renderings.

        "This land has long been home to narratives of creation: from today's
        industrial factories, tangled in the global web of capital, to
        yesterday's local economy of Naragansett artisanship. But even long
        before this land was touched by human hands, it was still a hub of
        production. The lifecycle of an ecosystem necessarily involves bringing
        objects into existence. Compounds assemble to create organisms anew;
        life forms amass to form symbioses. Human supply chains and ecological
        food chains apply the same principles of cyclic creation across vastly
        different beings and scales. After all, a tree and a factory are both
        plants."

      <p class="pad">
        For my final site plan I designed a minimally invasive proposal to
        encourage natural succession and regeneration through the creation of
        more-than-human habitat, biodiverse native planting, and regenerative
        agriculture.

        <br /><br />

        My core design principles were decolonization, ecological succession,
        urban agriculture, indigenous knowledge, and more-than-human
        cohabitation.

        Inspired by Tuck & Yang's seminal work,
        <a
          href="https://clas.osu.edu/sites/clas.osu.edu/files/Tuck%20and%20Yang%202012%20Decolonization%20is%20not%20a%20metaphor.pdf"
        >
          decolonization is not a metaphor</a
        >, an integral aspect of my site plan was repatriation of the land to
        its original stewards, under whose care it previously flourished: the
        Naragansett people.

        <br /><br />

        The proposal leaves most of the site's surface area undeveloped and
        includes limited human-oriented programming on the uncontaminated
        north-east region of the site. This programming centers around community
        gardens with plots available to local renters who lack access to private
        land, in an effort to increase access to green space and reduce local
        food insecurity. Additional interventions include a pavilion, seed
        library, composting facility, walking path, orchard, retention ponds,
        and nesting platforms.

        I designed terraced gardens to work with the land's existing slope,
        increase water conservation, and avoid digging into the
        nutrient-depleted soil. Community gardens would create a safe and
        accessible public space to practice growing methods indigenous to the
        Narragansett and Wampanoag regions, such as companion planting,
        intercropping, polycultures.

        Lining the 800-foot path from the gardens down to the shore of Omega
        Pond are a series of retention ponds for irrigation. The walking path
        ends with a boardwalk overlooking Omega Pond. The brackish water of the
        Seekonk presents a suitable climate for microalgae farming, which could
        be used as carbon sequestration, biomass fuel, or nitrogen-additive for
        composting.

        <br /><br />

        The space would be co-operated by community organizations such as the
        Narragansett Food Sovereignty Initiative, Tomaquag Museum, Zero Waste
        Providence, Groundwork Rhode Island, and the Southside Community Land
        Trust. Individual garden plots would be free to rent for East Providence
        residents.

        A remediation strategy that balances hands-off ecological succession
        with light-touch human intervention can transform the site a productive
        landscape once more. This transition signifies a departure from the
        site's extractive industrial legacy, and a return to its natural
        ecosystem.
